# CryptoCurrency Price Predictor
This is a python program which can predict the price of any Crypto Currency through Machine Learning.

It is a python based program which analyzes the data of last n days to predict the price of a any crypto currency for the next day. 

##Overview
>>Sklearn's RandomForestRegressor is used to program the basic model of the ML program.
>>There are two data set  X(independent) & y(dependent) dataset
>>Test_train_split is used to split the database into the testing and training data sample into ratio of 80:20.
>>Sample data is included in the repo.

This model can be modified to predict crypto of multiple days too. A graphical representation of the same can also be coded through Python Library MatplotlLib.

Accuracy of the model with current data is 0.96 which is around 96% and at price difference of 0.002$.
